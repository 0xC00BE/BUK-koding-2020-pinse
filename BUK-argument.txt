Why do you always do that?
I don't agree!
And what about you?
You always thin you know best!
Your mouth stinks!
I don't have more arguments, I give up!
I'am going to tell that to my mum!
You are stupid!
Can you please stop!
Never!
You are dumb!
You shouldn't say that!
That's racist!
Wow, just wow!
Like a small monkey!
What did you say?
Are you serious?
Please don't!
Can you repeat that to my face?
Like a child! As always!
We were so perfect Microsoft couple, what happened?
Stop!
Please continue!
You first!
This doesn't make sense!
Are you sure?
Is that your opinion or you red that on your stupid twitter?
Go make yourself a sandwitch!
Did you just post it on Snapchat?
I wonder how many likes I would get on Instagram!
Yeah, go ahead!
Why?
No idea!
